# Coding standards: awesome-photo-portfolio

A rule here is one sentence and a pointer. If it needs an argument, the argument is an ADR. An amendment goes in the ADR, never here. `/code-review` and `afk-code-review` judge every change against this file.

## Stack

- Install dependencies: `npm ci`
- Verify: `npm run verify`, which runs lint, then build, then test.
- `package.json` is the fact. When this section disagrees with it, this section is wrong.
- No new dependency without an ADR naming the need, the pick and the alternative rejected.
- A dependency considered and rejected is listed here with its ADR.
- Rejected: oxlint and Biome, in favour of ESLint. See ADR 0003.
- New code adds no lint suppressions. A change that fixes a suppressed finding runs `npx eslint src --prune-suppressions`. See ADR 0003.

## Modules

- Design modules with the vocabulary of Matt's `codebase-design` skill.
- One job per module, split by domain concern. No catch-all `utils` module.
- Logic modules hold no I/O and no UI. Code is pure by default, with side effects at the edges.
- One primary export per file, and the file is named for it.

## Rules that must not regress

Words in these rules are defined in `GLOSSARY.md`.

1. A guest never sees a private album or any of its photos. The Supabase policies enforce it, and the client filter only shapes the UI. See ADR 0002.
2. A new album is private until the owner makes it public. See "Key rules" in `CLAUDE.md`.
3. Only the owner creates, edits, reorders or deletes albums and photos. The Supabase policies and every function in `api/` check the owner's user id, not only that someone is signed in. See ADR 0002.
4. The guest UI has no download control and no link to the original file. See "Key rules" in `CLAUDE.md` and ADR 0001.
5. The gate covers every page except `/login`, and the owner skips it. See ADR 0001.

## Testing

- Tests run on vitest with jsdom and Testing Library. `npm run test` runs them all once.
- A test sits next to the file it covers, named `<file>.test.ts` or `<file>.test.tsx`.
- Every test mocks `./lib/supabase` with `vi.mock`, and no test touches the network.
- Each rule under "Rules that must not regress" has a test that fails when the rule breaks.

## Comments and docs

- A comment says why, when the code cannot. It never restates what the code does.
- A comment that depends on a handoff note or an ADR names the file.
- Domain words live in `GLOSSARY.md`, decisions in `docs/adr/`, agent workflow in `docs/agents/`, and long investigations in `docs/handoff/`. `CLAUDE.md` points at them.

## Definition of done

Before a PR opens:

1. The verify command is green. CI runs the same steps in the same order.
2. New logic and every bug fix come with a test.
3. No client data or secrets are committed.
4. The glossary, ADR and handoff updates the change implies are in the same PR.
